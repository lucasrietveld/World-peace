üåç The Pentivium: A Truth-Proof for World Peace

What is the Pentivium?

The Pentivium is a universal framework for testing truth.
It expands the ancient Trivium (Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric) with two more wheels ‚Äî Praxis and Presence ‚Äî creating a five-point star lattice where every claim, action, or system can be mapped.

Truth is no longer vague. Lies and tilts have a shape.
The Pentivium makes them visible.

‚∏ª

The Five Wheels
	1.	Grammar (Existence / Past)
Naming and defining forms. Guarding meaning against distortion.
	2.	Logic (Consequence / Future)
Ensuring promises align with outcomes. Mapping cause to effect.
	3.	Rhetoric (Expression / Present)
Revealing persuasion. Checking message against evidence and audience.
	4.	Praxis (Action / Time)
Testing intention through execution and feedback. Truth in deeds.
	5.	Presence (Witness / Eternity)
The embodied resonance of truth. Words, silence, and witness aligned.

Why It Matters
	‚Ä¢	As a Proof ‚Üí Every deception can be caught, every truth confirmed.
	‚Ä¢	As Human Software ‚Üí A method to think, speak, act, and live free of manipulation.
	‚Ä¢	As Governance ‚Üí The foundation for Citizen-Sovereign Governance (CSG), where people direct power with clarity and corruption collapses by structure.

The Mission

To spread the Pentivium as a shared language of truth,
so that humanity can:
	‚Ä¢	See deception for what it is,
	‚Ä¢	Rebuild trust in action and word,
	‚Ä¢	And unlock world peace through alignment with reality.

‚∏ª

The Pentivium is not a philosophy. It is a proof.
And with it, truth belongs to everyone.
